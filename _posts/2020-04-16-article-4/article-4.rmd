| Procedure/ what was examined ?       | 1.Comparing parts of the brain that understand metaphors of healthy people and people with schizophrenia, using MRI scanners.
|                                      | 2.Examining 30 patients who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and 30 healthy controls while undergoing a brain scan in a high-sensitivity MRI, they read 90 brief stories.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Conclusions/ discovery               | -People with schizophrenia employ different brain circuits to overcome initial lack of understanding.
|                                      | -Compared to controls, the patient group showed increased brain activity in certain areas, but lower brain activity in others.
