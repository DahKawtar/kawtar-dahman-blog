Psychology was always a subject that interested me strongly. Considering it's vastness, i decided to focus my portfolio on a known side of mental disorders which is "Schizophrenia". Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that prevent people to feel, behave or think rationally. People will have trouble to distinguish reality from what it's not due to hallucinations and delusions They might also find it troublesome to concentrate, memorise and participating in daily tasks, will also have disorganized speech and behavior. Depression is present in a high rate among shizophrenic people, sadly, suicide is too.

The exact cause of schizophrenia is still unknown, but it's believed that genetic factors, brain chemistry and environmental triggers may play a big role in it.

To give you a simple explanation, imagine yourself sitting in front of hundreds of televisions, all on different channels with the volume turned at the maximum, all day long. It will be really difficult to concentrate on just one of them, to make up one single sentence (By NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Illness).
