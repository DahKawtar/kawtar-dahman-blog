| Conclusions/ discovery               | - Discovering of a hidden clue in people's language indicator to psychosis.
|                                      | - People at risk for psychosis use more words associated with sound than the average.  |
| Remained questions ?                 | How much more will it take to find more quantified, objective ways to measure subtle variables, such as those                                                hidden within language usage ?                     |
