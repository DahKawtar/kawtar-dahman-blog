| Published in ? when (if mentioned) ? | September 09, 2019, in an editorial published in the British Journal of Psychiatry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| General topic                        | Schizophrenia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Procedure/ what was examined ?       | 1.Suggesting that Sarcosine could easily be incorporated into treatment plans.
|                                      | 2.Discovering that some patients with schizophrenia may have defects in the functioning of receptors for glutamate(a common neurotransmitter in the brain).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Conclusions/ discovery               | -Sarcosine can help glutamate receptors to work better.
|                                      | -Finding that if these glutamate receptors did not function properly then people could develop psychosis and other symptoms of schizophrenia.
|                                      | -Finding that genetic variants which damage this receptor increase the risk of schizophrenia.
|                                      | -Finding that the only risk identified so far seems to be that people who are on anti-depressants but takes Sarcosine to treat schizophrenia may experience hypomania (disinhibition and euphoria).
| Remained  questions ?                 | Sarcosine may be a helpful treatment for schizophrenia but further studies are needed to make it a certainty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
