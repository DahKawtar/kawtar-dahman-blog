Many psychiatric drugs act on the receptors or transporters of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. However, there is a great need for alternatives, and research is looking at other targets along the brain's metabolic pathways. Lack of glycine betaine contributes to brain pathology in schizophrenia, and new research shows that betaine supplementation can counteract psychiatric symptoms in mice.

| Procedure/ what was examined ?       | 1.Testing if betaine supplementation could help alleviate symptoms induced by PCP and methamphetamine in mice.
|                                      | 2.Investigation of postmortem human brain samples.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Conclusions/ discovery               | -Low levels of Betaine in the blood plasma might indicates the presence of shizophrenia.
|                                      | -Mices with low amount of the Chdh gene, that is involved in making betaine, showed depressive behaviors and greatly reduced betaine levels in both the brain and blood.
|                                      | -Psychedelic drugs like PCP and methamphetamine can also produce schizophrenia-like behaviors in both humans and mice.  
|                                      | -Finding that betaine not only improved cognitive deficits and behavioral abnormalities, it also reversed oxidative stress at the molecular level.
