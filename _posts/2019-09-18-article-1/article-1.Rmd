An 18-year study using the DNA of thousands of people in India has identified a new clue in the quest for causes of schizophrenia, and for potential treatments. This study identified a gene called NAPRT1 that encodes an enzyme involved in vitamin B3 metabolism.

|                                       |   DNA screening of thousand of people in India, in order to find genetic factors that causes schizophrenia and        |                                       |           potentiel treatements.|

|                                       |                                                      |
| Conclusions/ discovery                |                      - The gene NAPRT1 was found in a large genomic dataset of schizophrenia patients.|
|                                       |                        - In one percent of the population, schizophrenia is due to genetic factors.|
|                                       |                        - The mystery of which specific gene causes schizophrenia is still unsolved.   |
|                                       |                                                      |
| Remained questions                    |                What are the specific roles of the hundred genetic variants linked to schizophrenia ?         |
