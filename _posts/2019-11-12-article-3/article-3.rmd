Findings suggest a form of schizophrenia has more in common with neurodegenerative diseases than previously thought.

| General topic                        | Schizophrenia                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Procedure/ what was examined ?       | 1.Using brain tissue from deceased human donors to find schizophrenia prestance in neurodegenerative diseases.
|                                      | 2.Putting cells from the brain tissue samples in a specific detergent to analyze their contents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Conclusions/ discovery               | -Finding new evidence that schizophrenia can be marked by the buildup of abnormal proteins similar to those found in the brains of    |people with such neurodegenerative disorders as Alzheimer's or Huntington's diseases.
|                                      | -Less dissolved cell contents indicate that the cell contains a high volume of abnormal, misfolded proteins, as found in other brain diseases.
|                                      | -Detecting of a small protein ubiquitin that is a marker for protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disorders.   |
| Remained  questions ?                 | Is substantial variety in the disorder's symptoms linked to particular levels of excess abnormal proteins ? and how this leads to the disease ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
