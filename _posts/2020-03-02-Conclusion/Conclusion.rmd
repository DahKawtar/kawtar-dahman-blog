Schizophrenia is a serious disorder that should be studied carefully. Sadly, there is still no cure to it, currently. But it's still treatable. 
It's vert important to have a strong, resistant, support system anf to get the right medications. Antipsychotic medications are the most commonly prescribed. They are believed to affect the brain neurotransmitter dopamine, this latter known to be a hormone that is associated with happiness, which help to prevent depression and suicial thoughts.

There is no certitude to prevent schizophrenia, but the key is to stick with prescribed medications in order to prevent relapses or worsening it.
